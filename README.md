## Evaluation metrics

AUC-judd: Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, which is generated by plotting the true positive rate (y-axis) against the false positive rate (x-axis) at various threshold settings. The AUC-judd is calculated by averaging the ROC scores obtained at each fixation point. The AUC-judd score is a measure of how well the saliency map separates fixated from non-fixated points. The AUC-judd score ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates perfect performance and 0.5 indicates chance performance (https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/1604.03605#S3.F3).
